# Michael Brophy Photography
## milestone project 1
In this project I used one of my passions as inspiration to build a fictional website for my photography business.
although the images I have used are not my own you can see exactly how the layout would suit any photographer of any style.
I have used my time throughout the project using mostly my own coding and searching for fixes to any problems I ran into, any coding 
I have used that is not my own will be credited at the bottom of this page.
### UX
* USER STORIES
  *  As a user I would like to know more about the photographer I want to choose.
  *  As a user I want to find a photographer that has different packages to choose from.
  *  As a user I want to be able to see examples of previous work.
  *  As a user I want to see customer reviews.
  * As a returning user I have liked the style of photography and packages and want to book.
* DESIGN
  
    When designing this website I wanted to give it a feel of luxury, I decided to use the royal blue as my primary colour accompanied with a dark grey and #fafafa white for lettering, a lighter blue for button hover and 0, 0, 0, 0.2 over the body to give it a light grey colour. For the typography I have used the Jost font for headers with Roboto for the paragraphs with a font size of 16px and line spacing to 140% making all text easy to read. I have used some beautiful photographs throughout the website and have used the rule of thirds for the hero image. I wanted to make sure the user got to where they wanted as easily as possible, so adding buttons on the home page to the gallery and packages is a key feature. I have tried to make the website easy to navigate while getting straight to the point, A gallery for users to see previous work, three packages to choose from and a contact page.

### DEPLOYMENT
   I started out with creating a new repository with the Code Institute template, I gave the repository a name of milestone-1 and added a README.md file. I then added the necessary files to the repoitory eg: index.html, assets folder with images and css folder, style.css and the other html pages. throughout the build of the website I used `git add .` to add it to my local git, and `git commit -m "message"` to commit it to my local git. I used `git push` to push the repository to the remote git hub, I then launched the site on git hub pages by selecting the master branch on the github pages section in options. I was then able to test the site across multiple browsers and make any changes accordingly, then repeat the process of git add, git commit and git push.
### FEATURES
 * TECHNOLOGY USED
   
   * HTML
   * CSS
   * Bootstrap (only for the buttons)
 * TESTING
   * USER STORY TESTING
     
     I have had a number of family members test the website for me, they have agreed that the website is a good representative of the user stories. 
   * FURTHER TESTING
     I have published the site on github pages and tested it on chrome, Microsoft edge, Firefox, internet explorer and safari. I have also ran tests on the code using w3c validater and have ran all text through a spell checker.

   * KNOW BUGS
      The bugs that I have come across are, internet explorer browser is not understanding new forms of coding and dosnt display the content on my website how it should be displayed, i think this is down to internet explorer not being developed any further.
      
      I have added images to the package cards, they would only displaying the gradiant overlay and not the image when you open the page in a different browser. (Fixed, this was down to the way i was locating the image, I used `/assets/images/wddingphoto20.jpg` when i should of used `../images/weddingphoto.jpg`)

      I had a problem having the image slider working on mobile devices. (Fixed, this was down to having the keyframes below the responsive section in the CSS file. )
